  "description": "This application allows the exploration of multiple heuristics for bootstrapping a local search solver of the travelling salesman problem. It also allows the exploration of state of the art optimization operators such as 2-opt and 3-opt. The application visulizes all intermediate tours built by the local search algorithm and keeps track of their cost. ",
